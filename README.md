# face-digit-classification

Facial recognition has many important industry use cases and necessitates machine learning algorithms to extract information from unstructured text or image files. This project explores how to recognize digit and face using Naive Bayes, KNN, and Perceptron classifiers. Since the input data is not in a structured format, each algorithm is natively coded to account for the unique input format. This is an assignment from the Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course at Rutgers University.
